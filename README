This project is a cross platform command line application for finding prime 
numbers. It is an implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthene method of finding 
primes, more details can be found here: 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes

This is written in C++ using a vector<bool> to store the primes. This is 
because vector<bool> uses less memory than other containers as it is specilised
so that each bool is stored in only a bit. This means that this class can 
calculate higher primes than if, for example, a vector<int> was used.

Large limits have also been used so that more primes can be calculated, so that
this is portable large_int.h defines the largest unsigned integer that can be 
used and defines LARGE_INT as the largest type of integer.

Under a speed test the 50,847,534 primes below 1,000,000,000 were calculated in
176 seconds on a AMD Athlon(tm) II X4 605e Processor Ã— 4 with 2.7 GiB of RAM.
