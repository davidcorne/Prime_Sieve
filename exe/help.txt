Usage: prime_finder.exe <options>

This finds the primes below a specified limit. On running you will be asked
what limit you would like to set.

The default behaviour is for the executable is to print all the primes under 
the given number to standard output.

Note: This uses the sieve of Eratosthenes Method and is known to work for
      calculating all the primes under 3,000,000,000. Also for large primes it 
      is better to input them when prompted rather than as an argument due to 
      implicit conversion to 32 bit long rather than 64 bit.

Options:

-c                 Asks for a limit and runs the prime finder using all the 
                   algorithms that are available.
-f <file-name>     Writes the output to a given file name.
